### :eyeglasses: Virtual reality for everyone by [Liyas Thomas](https://github.com/liyasthomas)

### Features :sparkles:

:eyeglasses: **Virtual Reality made simple**: Lvr contains the 3D and [WebVR](https://webvr.info) boilerplates required to get running across platforms including mobile, desktop, Vive, and Rift. It works on any phone with [WebGL](https://caniuse.com/#feat=webgl) and [WebRTC](https://caniuse.com/#feat=stream).

:heart: **Declarative HTML**: HTML is easy to read and copy-and-paste. Since Lvr can be used from HTML, Lvr is accessible to everyone: web developers, VR enthusiasts, educators, artists, makers, kids. It is completely open source and free of charge!

:electric_plug: **Entity-Component Architecture**: Lvr is a powerful framework on top of [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js), providing a declarative, composable, reusable entity-component structure. While Lvr can be used from HTML, developers have unlimited access to JavaScript, DOM APIs, three.js, [WebVR](https://webvr.info), and [WebGL](https://caniuse.com/#feat=webgl).

:zap: **Performance**: Lvr is a thin framework on top of [AR.js](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js) and [A-Frame](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe). Although A-Frame uses the DOM, A-Frame does not touch the browser layout engine. Performance is a top priority, being battle-tested on highly interactive [WebVR](https://webvr.info) experiences. It runs efficiently even on mobile phones!

:globe_with_meridians: **Cross-Platform**: Build VR applications for Vive, Rift, Daydream, GearVR, and Cardboard. Don't have a headset or controllers? No problem! Lvr still works on standard desktop and smartphones. It is a pure web solution, so no installation required. Full JavaScript based on [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) + [jsartoolkit5](https://github.com/artoolkit/jsartoolkit5).

## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

- A device which supports [WebGL](https://caniuse.com/#feat=webgl) and [WebRTC](https://caniuse.com/#feat=stream) with a working camera input
- Internet connection
- A web browser that supports [WebVR](https://webvr.info). Works best with Chrome on Android devices. You can still experience [WebVR](https://webvr.info) content in other browsers on Android and iOS, but it might not be as smooth since those browsers donâ€™t fully support [WebVR](https://webvr.info)
- [Wonder](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_(emotion)>)! :heart:

### Demo: Try it on mobile :iphone:

It works on all platforms. Android, iOS and Windows phone. It runs on **any browser with [WebGL](https://caniuse.com/#feat=webgl) and [WebRTC](https://caniuse.com/#feat=stream)** (for iOS, you need to update to iOS 11).

Try on your phone in only two easy steps, check it out!

1. Open [marker image from here](https://github.com/liyasthomas/lvr/blob/main/assets/images/patterns/barcode/1.png) in your browser.
2. Open my [augmented reality web app](https://liyasthomas.github.io/lvr) in your phone browser. Give permissions to access camera. Scan marker image with your camera.

You're done! It will open a web page which read the phone's webcam, localize a marker and add 3D on top of it.
